# The Evolution of Frontend Architecture

Web development has come a long way since the days of static HTML and CSS. Today, we're witnessing a paradigm shift that's redefining how we build and deploy applications.

## Why Performance Matters More Than Ever

In an era where attention spans are shrinking, performance is no longer just a metric—it's a feature.

<Callout type="info" title="Did you know?">
  According to Google, a 1-second delay in mobile load times can impact conversion rates by up to 20%.
</Callout>

### Core Web Vitals

Understanding the three pillars of page experience is crucial:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Loading performance
2. **First Input Delay (FID)**: Interactivity
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Note">
  Starting in March 2024, Interaction to Next Paint (INP) will replace FID as a Core Web Vital metric.
</Callout>

## Modern Tools for Modern Problems

Let's look at how we can leverage new tools to solve old problems.

```typescript
// Example of a modern React Server Component
async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {
  const post = await db.post.findUnique({
    where: { slug },
    select: { title: true, content: true }
  });

  if (!post) return <NotFound />;

  return (
    <article className="prose lg:prose-xl">
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <MDXRemote source={post.content} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

## The Rise of Edge Computing

Edge computing is bringing computation closer to the user, reducing latency and improving the overall user experience.

### Benefits of Edge Deployment:

- **Reduced Latency**: Logic runs closer to the user
- **Improved Security**: Distributed attacks are harder to coordinate
- **Better Scalability**: Automatic scaling at the edge

## Conclusion

As we move forward, the line between frontend and backend continues to blur. Embracing these changes is not just about staying current—it's about building better experiences for everyone.
